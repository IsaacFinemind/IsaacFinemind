3.   <p>Come here, darling, think it's time
Let you heart open up
Cheers to love, broken wild
Leaving you lost and scarred
You've been lonely just like me
And chose nothing but a dream
Come here, darling, take my hand
We'll pull through, you and me
'Cause two hearts are better than one
Pull me closer
Hold me like we're gonna die young
It's almost over
Kiss me now before we say goodbye
Two hearts are better than one
Two hearts are better than one
Future's lost, so it seems
Only now carries me
Past is gone with the wind
Like unkept promises
But we still got tonight
'Til the light breaks us up
Come here, darling, let's stay out
'Til the morning, you and I
'Cause two hearts are better than one
Pull me closer
Hold me like we're gonna die young
It's almost over
Kiss me now before we say goodbye
Two hearts are better than one
Two hearts are better than one
'Cause two hearts are better than one
Pull me closer
Hold me like we're gonna die young
It's almost over
Kiss me now before we say goodbye
'Cause two hearts are better than one
Two hearts are better than one
Two hearts are better than one
'Cause two hearts are better than one
Pull me closer
Hold me like we're gonna die young
It's almost over
Kiss me now before we say goodbye
Two hearts are better than one
Two hearts are better than one
